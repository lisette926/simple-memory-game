Submitted by: Lisette Hawkins

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3.org - CSS properties and color keywords
Tutorial Gateway - Nested if statements]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I encountered was creating the guess function for my memory game. I was not sure how to create it at first since I was thinking of creating a loop with nested conditions that would continue the game until the player guesses incorrectly. However, I determined that a loop would not work because it would not take into account the progress of the game leading to the game continuing to play the following sequence and may never stop. Thus, I decided that if statements were a better option. I was also not sure about the syntax of nested if statements; thus, I researched it and created a similar guess function as the version provided.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this submission, I am curious about what other programming languages can be used to create websites and applications. I found it interesting how this game uses three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is interesting how they each have a purpose and work together to create an amazing finished product. Thus, I am wondering what other programming languages can be useful in web development and how they work together to create websites and games. I would like to learn different programming languages so that I can become a better programmer and obtain a better understanding of web development.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add a point system and the ability to see your score. I would make sure that every time that the user is rewarded 10 points for every time he or she inputs the correct pattern. Then, the user would be able to see the score they have at the corner of the screen. I would also add levels to the game and create different challenges once the user reaches a specific level. For example, once the user reaches level 3, which would mean that they have guessed the pattern correctly 3 times, a new button would be added to the game and it would go slightly faster.]
